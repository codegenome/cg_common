## Comments begin with a '#' and extend through the end of the line. Keywords
## are case insensitive. All path's MUST BE FULLY QUALIFIED, starting with '/'.
##
## Below you will find examples of some frequently used statements. For
## information about the control file, a complete list of statements and
## options please have a look in the monit manual.
##
##
###############################################################################
## Global section
###############################################################################
##
## Start monit in the background (run as a daemon):
#
set daemon 60 # check services at 2-minute intervals
# with start delay 240 # optional: delay the first check by 4-minutes
# # (by default check immediately after monit start)
#
#
## Set syslog logging with the 'daemon' facility. If the FACILITY option is
## omitted, monit will use 'user' facility by default. If you want to log to
## a stand alone log file instead, specify the path to a log file
#
set logfile syslog facility log_daemon
#
#
### Set the location of monit id file which saves the unique id specific for
### given monit. The id is generated and stored on first monit start.
### By default the file is placed in $HOME/.monit.id.
#
# set idfile /var/.monit.id
#
### Set the location of monit state file which saves the monitoring state
### on each cycle. By default the file is placed in $HOME/.monit.state. If
### state file is stored on persistent filesystem, monit will recover the
### monitoring state across reboots. If it is on temporary filesystem, the
### state will be lost on reboot.
#
# set statefile /var/.monit.state
#
## Set the list of mail servers for alert delivery. Multiple servers may be
## specified using comma separator. By default monit uses port 25 - this
## is possible to override with the PORT option.
#
set mailserver localhost # primary mailserver
# backup.bar.baz port 10025, # backup mailserver on port 10025
# localhost # fallback relay
#
#
## By default monit will drop alert events if no mail servers are available.
## If you want to keep the alerts for a later delivery retry, you can use the
## EVENTQUEUE statement. The base directory where undelivered alerts will be
## stored is specified by the BASEDIR option. You can limit the maximal queue
## size using the SLOTS option (if omitted, the queue is limited by space
## available in the back end filesystem).
#
# set eventqueue
# basedir /var/monit # set the base directory where events will be stored
# slots 100 # optionaly limit the queue size
#
#
## Send status and events to M/Monit (Monit central management: for more
## informations about M/Monit see http://www.tildeslash.com/mmonit).
#
# set mmonit http://monit:monit@192.168.1.10:8080/collector
#
#
## Monit by default uses the following alert mail format:
##
## --8<--
## From: monit@$HOST # sender
## Subject: monit alert -- $EVENT $SERVICE # subject
##
## $EVENT Service $SERVICE #
## #
## Date: $DATE #
## Action: $ACTION #
## Host: $HOST # body
## Description: $DESCRIPTION #
## #
## Your faithful employee, #
## monit #
## --8<--
##
## You can override this message format or parts of it, such as subject
## or sender using the MAIL-FORMAT statement. Macros such as $DATE, etc.
## are expanded at runtime. For example, to override the sender:
#
set mail-format { from: support-application_name-rails_env@codegenome.com }
#
#
## You can set alert recipients here whom will receive alerts if/when a
## service defined in this file has errors. Alerts may be restricted on
## events by using a filter as in the second example below.
#
# set alert support@codegenome.com # receive all alerts
set alert support@codegenome.com only on { timeout } # receive just service-
# # timeout alert
#
#
## Monit has an embedded web server which can be used to view status of
## services monitored, the current configuration, actual services parameters
## and manage services from a web interface.
#
set httpd port 2812
use address helios.codegenome.com allow 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 allow genome:b1avaw24
